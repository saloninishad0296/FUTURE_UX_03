1- Consistent Navigation
A fixed left sidebar is used across all screens (Dashboard, Leads, Clients, Tasks, Analytics, Settings) to maintain orientation and reduce cognitive load.

2- Clear Information Hierarchy
Primary actions (e.g., Add New Lead / New Task) and key metrics are placed at the top of screens so users can quickly take action without searching.

3- Visual Workflow Representation
The sales pipeline uses a Kanban-style layout to make lead stages easy to understand and manage at a glance.

4- Context-Rich Detail Views
Client profiles combine contact details, activity timeline, deliverables, follow-ups, and client health in one view, reducing the need to switch between multiple pages.

5- Task-Focused Productivity
Task views prioritise urgency and progress with filters (Today, Overdue, This Week, Completed), clear priority tags, and status controls to support daily execution.
