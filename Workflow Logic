The CRM follows the natural agency workflow:

Leads → Clients → Tasks → Follow-ups → Performance Tracking

1- Leads move through a visual sales pipeline.
2- Converted leads become clients with dedicated profiles.
3- Tasks and deliverables are assigned to team members with priorities and due dates.
4- Follow-ups and reminders ensure nothing is missed.
5- The dashboard and analytics provide a high-level view of performance and workload.
6- This structure mirrors how agencies operate in real life, making the system intuitive to use.
